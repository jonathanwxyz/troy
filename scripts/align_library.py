"""Align recordings of library texts (data/library.sqlite) to their text, and give the
reader one audio file per book.

    .venv/bin/python scripts/align_library.py [SLUG ...] [--book N] [--no-audio]

Which recordings go with which book is in the local catalogue (library/catalogue.json),
an "audio" list on a text:

    "audio": [
      {"div": 1, "from": ["Work pt1", "Work pt2"], "credit": "Recording: …"},
      {"div": "2-24", "from": ["Playlist"], "credit": "Recording: …"}]

"from" names folders under recordings/ (as make_emissions.py --links made them: audio
files in reading order, their emissions in cache/<file>.mms.npy). With one book ("div":
1), all the audio files of those folders, in order, are joined into one recording. With
a range ("div": "2-24"), each book gets one file of the folder: the Nth file (in name
order) for book N, so a playlist of every book can start later (here, at book 2).

The recordings often hold more than the text: an introduction or LibriVox's
announcements at the start and end of each part, a spoken title, a translation read
after each passage. So between any two units of text (and before the first and after
the last) the alignment may pass over audio that matches nothing, at a fixed cost per
frame (STAR_COST): speech that matches the text costs far less, speech that doesn't
far more.

Units: a line of verse; in prose, each sentence (or the part of one within a Stephanus
section: segments break at sections, and sentences carry across them). They are stored,
with their text, in data/library_audio.sqlite, which a rebuild of library.sqlite leaves
alone (realign after a rebuild that changes a text):

  recordings (text, div, file, credit, frames): the reader's audio file, a path under
      recordings/: the recording itself when a book has one file; parts are joined
      into recordings/<slug>-<div>.<ext> by stream copy (as they are, not re-encoded)
  units (text, div, seq, piece, content, start, speech_end, end, score): seq is the
      segment in library.sqlite, piece the sentence within it (0 for verse); times in
      seconds (start: first sound; speech_end: last sound; end: the next unit's start);
      score the mean log-probability per frame along the path (higher = surer)

Needs uroman (the text is romanized for the MMS aligner's vocabulary), numpy, ffmpeg;
the emissions come from make_emissions.py, no model is run here.
