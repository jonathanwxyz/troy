"""Split Murray's passages (translation_passages) into single Greek lines, using the
hand-made cut points in data/translation_lines/murray_book<NN>.txt, and store them in
data/iliad.sqlite as `translation_lines`.

Run after import_translation.py. Each cut-point entry is `book.line first words`: the
line's English starts at those words, searched for after the previous cut within the
passage. Checks that every line of a split passage has an entry and that the pieces
rejoin to the passage text exactly.
