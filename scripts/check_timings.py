"""Sanity-check verse timings (verse_timings) against the pauses in each recording.

    python3 scripts/check_timings.py [book ...]

A correctly placed verse start falls where speech resumes after a pause, so for each
book this reports the share of verse starts at a pause (Book 1: ~96%; the rest are
run-on lines read without one), the spoken title's length, and verses squeezed to
under a second (the sign of an aligner that lost its place). Pauses are detected with
ffmpeg's silencedetect and cached in recordings/cache/<file>.silences.txt.
